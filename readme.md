# What is Reframe?

[Reframe](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe) is a powerful open-source framework for creating
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) web apps. It gets you quickly started and doesn't get in the way
when your app becomes more complex. It supports [React](https://reactjs.org/) and
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for the front-end.

# What is Up?

[Up](https://github.com/apex/up) is an open-source tool that deploys your web app to
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) in your own AWS account. Hosting your app on AWS will
remain free as long as it doesn't consume much memory and you have less than a million requests per
month.
